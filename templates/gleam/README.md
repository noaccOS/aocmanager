## Manually running the program

The template is meant to be run through `aoc`, but you can run it manually using `gleam test`

- `gleam test a`: run the solution A
- `gleam test b`: run the solution B
- `gleam test both`: run the solutions for both A and B
- `gleam test samples-a`: run your solutions on the samples for A
- `gleam test samples-b`: run your solutions on the samples for B
- `gleam test samples-both`: run your solutions on the samples for both A and B
